            After developing an accessibility audit process that worked for me,
            I created Sa11y, a user-friendly website to share the process to
            help beginners start their accessibility journey.

            When I joined nib, I wanted a way to preview all the components
            available in our design system. So, I developed a simple site to
            show visuals of the components and link them to the design system. I
            shared it around and have received lots of positive feedback.

            DesignSync is a Figma plugin for designers to help standardise and
            organise their design files for developer handoff and better overall
            navigation and discoverability.

            This plugin allows designers to view key states such as empty
            states, error states across iOS, Android and Web. Then generate the
            selected screen onto the canvas.

            After the release of the TV show Ted, I decided to up my Lorem Ipsum
            game and make a plugin that replaces placeholder text with quotes
            from the show.

            This is just a simple file showing how dynamic type changes font
            sizes in designs that used Apple type. I translated the fonts from
            Xcode PT's into Figma PXs.

          <p class="caption">Python script</p>
          <p>
            When auditing design system colours, I needed a method to determine
            if a hex value was associated with a specific colour token. This
            script enables you to analyze hex values and in case of no match, it
            will locate the nearest color token.
